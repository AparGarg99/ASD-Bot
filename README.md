## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
### BACKGROUND
Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) refers to a group of disorders characterized by delays 
in the development of socialization and communication skills. In 2013, researchers found that 
diagnosis of PDD which include:
• Autism 
• Asperger Syndrome 
• Childhood Disintegrative Disorder 
• Rett Syndrome 
• Not Otherwise Specified
was not consistent across clinics since they tend to have very similar signs and symptoms. So, 
they replaced all these medical terms with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) which 
encompasses all the PDD but uses a scale/spectrum that differentiates based on the severity of 
Social Communication deficits and Restrictive and Repetitive behavior/interests/activities. It’s 
thought that using this scale of symptoms as opposed to differentiating between PDD will help in 
giving a more accurate and useful diagnosis. For example, those with what was previously 
described as Asperger Syndrome would now likely fall under severity level 1 (low) than in level 
3 (high).
Approximately 1.8% of children in the U.S. have a diagnosis of ASD, a rate that has more than 
doubled over the past two decades. In 2021, people of all races and socioeconomic groups are 
impacted by the disorder. Worldwide, roughly 1 in 160 people is thought to have ASD [2]. The 
condition begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person’s life

### BUSINESS CASE
Parents of children with atypical development can feel quite stressed and confused when the 
child is in the nascent stage. They may have a lot of questions in their mind regarding symptoms, 
screening, and treatment options, etc. Similarly, when faced with the diagnosis of ASD, parents 
can easily be overwhelmed by the news and may have a lot of questions regarding causes, and 
child’s future, etc. In such difficult times, finding answers on search engines like Google, 
despite them being the de-facto places to get answers to all queries, can be very frustrating since 
the information is spread across different web pages. No single web source can provide the 
answers to all queries. In addition, with misinformation being rampant these days, checking the 
authenticity of information on web pages is next to impossible.

### SOLUTION
In this project, we have introduced a medical domain-specific chatbot system, which can answer 
frequently asked queries related to ASD by gathering and summarizing information from various 
authentic web sources. Moreover, it provides other useful features including the ‘M-CHAT
Screening test’ and ‘Special Needs Learning Facilities Nearby’ to aid parents of autistic children. 
We have leveraged the natural language processing capabilities provided by Google’s 
Dialogflow service to develop the chatbot and have later deployed it on Google Assistant, one of 
the most popular and widely used messaging services, to provide easy and quick access to users.
