      " The cause is unknown at present but it is generally accepted that it is caused by variations in brain structure or function. There is evidence to suggest that genetics plays an important role in the cause of ASD; it is likely to be multiple genes. Genes may create a “susceptibility” to developing ASD but researchers have not yet identified a single \"trigger\" that causes ASD to develop. There is no medical or genetic screening currently available.\n",

      "Individuals with ASD vary greatly in their communication skills. Some individuals are highly articulate and effective communicators, often well above their chronological age. Some individuals may never develop language. Others may develop simple language or some may not develop speech but may communicate with devices, signing, pictures or writing. Those who do communicate verbally may still have difficulties with the subtleties of language such as tone of voice, knowing when to stop talking and adapting their language to suit their audience.\n",
