People with ASD don't look different, but the way they interact with the world around them is different. The way people with ASD learn, think, and problem solve can vary from being gifted in math, art, music, or visual skills, to being severely challenged both mentally and physically. Many people with ASD can live independently, while some need assistance in daily living.\n",
