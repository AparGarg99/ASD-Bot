       " 'In toddlers, obvious symptoms may not be present, so it is often the absence of expected behavior that indicates a developmental problem. Autism has two core symptom domains as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5): The first is deficits in social communication and social interaction, and the second is repetitive and restricted behaviors and interests. The ways in which these symptoms manifest themselves vary from one child to the next. Common symptoms to look for include: fleeting eye contact, limited gesturing such as pointing or waving, limited pretend play, difficulty reading nonverbal cues, odd language such as scripted speech or echolalia (repeating another person’s words), repetitive motor movements, and difficulties with changes in environment or routine.',\n",
       " 'Families have reported improvements in behavior and language as a result of special diets, including elimination diets that remove gluten (a protein in wheat and related grains) and casein (a protein in milk). However, research results do not support the widespread use of elimination diets as a treatment for autism symptoms.',\n",
       " 'The primary and first-line treatments include intensive behavioral and educational therapies that promote the development of the unique social and communication deficits seen in individuals with autism. Specific interventions should be tailored to each individual’s needs and may include both behavioral and pharmacological interventions. Many children benefit from a multidisciplinary team that may include applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapists, speech and language pathologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists and other professionals. There is currently no cure for autism.']"
