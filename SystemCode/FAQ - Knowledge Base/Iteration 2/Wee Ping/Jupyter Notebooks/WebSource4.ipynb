People with Asperger syndrome come from all nationalities and cultural, religious and social backgrounds. \\xa0Historically, more men have been diagnosed as autistic than\\xa0women, although this is beginning to change.\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nSome people with Asperger syndrome say the world feels overwhelming and this can cause them considerable anxiety. In particular, understanding and relating to other people, and taking part in everyday family, school, work and social life, can be harder. Other people appear to know, intuitively, how to communicate and interact with each other, yet can also struggle to build rapport with people with Asperger syndrome. People with Asperger syndrome may wonder why they are 'different' and feel their social differences mean people don’t understand them.\\n\\nAutistic people often do not 'look' disabled. Some parents of autistic children say that other people simply think their child is naughty, while adults may find that they are misunderstood.\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nSome people see a formal diagnosis as an unhelpful label, but for many, getting a thorough assessment and diagnosis may be helpful because:\\n\\nit helps people with Asperger syndrome (and their families, partners, employers, colleagues, teachers and friends) to understand why they may experience certain difficulties and what they can do about them\\nit allows people to access services and support.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe characteristics of Asperger syndrome vary from one person to another, although there are some key traits that autistic people share.\\xa0These are: \\xa0\\n\\npersistent difficulties with or differences in social communication and social interaction\\xa0\\nrestricted and repetitive patterns of behaviours, activities or interests since early childhood, to the extent that these impact negatively on day to day life.\\n\\nThe diagnosis process usually involves a multi-disciplinary diagnostic team - often including a speech and language therapist, paediatrician, psychiatrist and/or psychologist.\\n\\nBecause Asperger syndrome varies widely from person to person, making a diagnosis can be difficult. It is often diagnosed later in children than autism and sometimes symptoms may not be recognised and diagnosed until adulthood.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOver the years, different diagnostic labels have been used, such as: autism, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC), classic autism, Kanner autism, pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), high-functioning autism (HFA), Asperger syndrome and Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA). This reflects the different diagnostic manuals and tools used, and the different autism profiles presented by individuals.\\n\\nBecause of recent and upcoming changes to the main diagnostic manuals, 'Autism Spectrum Disorder' (ASD) is now likely to become the most commonly given diagnostic term. Asperger syndrome remains a useful profile for many diagnosticians and professionals.\\n\"]"
