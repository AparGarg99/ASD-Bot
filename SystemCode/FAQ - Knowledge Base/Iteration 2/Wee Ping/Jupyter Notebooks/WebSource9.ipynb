Social interactions are subtle and constantly changing, and autistic people may have challenges keeping up with verbal and non-verbal messages that are being communicated – their behaviour may be misunderstood and believed to be rude.Feeling judged can be very stressful for autistic people and their families.

The findings confirmed that there is no single term that everyone prefers — but they did suggest a shift towards identity-driven language, and an understanding that autism is seen as integral to the person.This shift in preference is consistent with the feedback Amaze has received from the Australian autistic community. To reflect this preference, Amaze uses the term autistic person. Read more about this decision in Amaze’s strategic plan.The term autism includes autism/autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome and Pervasive Developmental Disorder – Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS).When diagnosing autism, health professionals use the term Autism Spectrum Disorder to describe the varied presentation of autistic individuals. These specific terms are also often required for diagnostic and funding purposes.You might also hear terms like high functioning, low functioning, severe and mild in an attempt to describe the extent of the challenges experienced by autistic people. However, every autistic individual has different strengths and challenges, and these terms ignore the difficulties some autistic people may experience and the capabilities of others. Amaze uses the terms high support needs and low support needs instead of high or low functioning.Amaze recognises that our community includes people with diverse viewpoints and identities.
