Talk to you pediatrician about the possibility of conducting these visits virtually​ if that is your preference. In addition, school, supports, activities, and routines may have also been disrupted due to the pandemic. Due to school closures and the absence of in-person interaction, teachers may be less able to recognize social and communication differences in their students, thus missing another opportunity for early identification.Access to school services and therapies has been more difficult for many.

      "Your child's pediatric primary health care provider will start screening your baby for signs of developmental or communication challenges like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at his or her very first well-child visit. They observe how your baby giggles, looks to you for reassurance, tries to regain your attention during a conversation, points or waves, responds to his or her name, and cries. It is those observations―in combination with family history, health examinations, and parents' perspectives―that help pediatric primary health care providers identify children at risk for ASD.\n",
      "\n",
      "ALL children should receive a formalized ASD screening at their 18- and 24-month well-child visits:\n",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening all children for ASD at the 18 and 24-month well-child visits in addition to regular developmental surveillance and screening. This type of screening can identify children with significant developmental and behavioral challenges early, when they may benefit most from intervention, as well as those with other developmental difficulties. For screening to be effective, it must be applied to all children – not only those with symptoms.\n",
      "There are multiple different tools your provider can choose to screen for ASD. While the AAP does not endorse any specific ASD screening tool over another, here are some your child's provider may use: Ages and Stages Questionnaires SE-2 (ASQ-SE2)Pervasive Developmental Disorders Screening Test-II (PDDST-II)Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales (CSBS)Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers – Revised with follow-up (M-CHAT-R/F)The M-CHAT-R/F the most common screening tool used in pediatric offices. It is a 23-point questionnaire filled out by parents. Most families find it easy to fill out. Using this standardized screening tool, pediatricians will be prompted to start conversations about language delays, concerns about behavior, or possible next steps for a child at risk with additional genetic, neurologic, or developmental testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Screening isn't diagnosing!\n",

Don't wait to talk with your child's doctor about doing more. Before you go to the appointment, complete a free developmental milestone checklist, and read these tips about \"How to Talk with the Doctor.\"You know your child best and your concerns are important.

      "\n",
      "Early diagnosis requires a partnership between parents and pediatricians. Within this partnership you, as the parent, should feel comfortable bringing up any concerns you have about your child's behavior or development—the way he or she plays, learns, speaks, and acts. Likewise, your child's pediatrician's role in the partnership is to listen and act on your concerns.During your child's visits, the pediatrician may ask specific questions or complete a questionnaire about your child's development. Pediatricians take these steps because they understand the value of early diagnosis and intervention and know where to refer you if concerns are identified. The importance of this partnership cannot be stressed enough.​Why ALL children are screened for autism:  If your child does have autism, an early diagnosis is better because then your child can start receiving the help he or she needs. This is why the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends all children be screened for ASD at their 18- and 24-month well-child checkups. Talk with your doctor if you feel your child needs to be screened (regardless of their age) and share your concerns—you know your child the best!\n",

Many will have meaningful relationships with family and peers and achieve a good level of independence as adults. \r\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "​​​​​​By: Susan Hyman, MD, FAAP & Lori McIlwainAnyone who's been a parent long enough has felt that panic—often only temporary—when a child wanders out of sight. Kids can get lost anywhere—at an amusement park, in a store, in a crowd, and sometimes even right in your own neighborhood. Many parents of children with \r\n",
      "   autism spectrum disorder (ASD) know this feeling all too well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Scope of the Problem: The first \r\n",
      "   study to quantify the scope of the problem was published in \r\n",
      "   Pediatrics in 2012. Results were significant. Of the 1,218 children with ASD who were studied, almost half of those children had wandered off from home, school, or another safe place at least once after age 4. Many were missing long enough to cause concern, were in danger of drowning, or were at risk of being hurt by traffic. \n",
      "\n",
      "What Parents Can Do: There are things parents can do to protect their c​hildren with ASD from this very real and scary danger. Here are tips from the American Academy of Pediatrics: \n",
      "Know wandering triggers. Children with ASD can be impulsive and typically wander or bolt from a safe setting to get to something of interest, such as water, the park, or train tracks—or to get away from a situation they find stressful or frightening, such as one with loud noises, commotion, or bright lights.  \n",
      "Secure your home—regardless of your child's age. Shut and lock doors that lead outside. Consider putting alarms on doors to alert you if a door has been opened.\n",
      "Work on communication and behavior strategies. Teaching your child strategies to self-calm when stressed and appropriately respond to \"no\" can make a big difference. Make sure your child's teachers and other family members understand how important it is to keep your child engaged and busy to reduce his or her urge or opportunity to wander.\n",
      "Set expectations. Before going out in a public place, communicate the plan with your child and other family members—including the timeline and rules to follow. Consider noise-canceling headphones if noise is a trigger, and use the \"tag team\" approach to make certain your child is always supervised by a trusted adult. \n",
      "Consider monitoring technology and identification. More than 1/3 of children with ASD who wander are never or rarely able to communicate their name, address, or phone number. It may be helpful to have things like GPS devices, medical alert tags, and even their name marked in clothing. \r\n",
      "         Project Lifesaver and \r\n",
      "         SafetyNet Tracking or other programs may be available through your local law enforcement agencies.\n",
      "Rest. Children with ASD may be less hyperactive and less likely to wander during the night if they have a sleep management plan and a \r\n",
      "         regular sleep schedule. Caregivers who get enough sleep are also more vigilant. Many children with ASD may have sleep problems.  If your child is having problems going to sleep or staying asleep, talk to your pediatrician for further evaluation and treatment.   Drowning is the cause of death for almost 3 in 4 children with autism who wander off alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reinforce water and swimming safety. Home swimming pools should be surrounded by a fence that prevents a child from getting to the pool from the house. There is no substitute for at least a four-foot-high, non-climbable, four-sided fence with a self-closing, self-latching gate; some states require at least 5 feet.  \n",
      "Pool alarms and door alarms are also protection products that may have some benefits. Note, however, that swimming lessons are not enough to prevent drowning; \r\n",
      "                  swimming lessons in wet clothes and shoes could be suggested for children with ASD who tend to wander.\n",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends a family supervision plan for children with ASD and other special needs. Have a checklist of nearby ponds, lakes and pools to search if a child wanders. \r\n",
      "                  Download an emergency plan here. \n",
      "To find swim lessons, contact your local parks and recreation facility or YMCA. Many communities have free or low-cost programs. Swim programs are tailored to meet cultural, religious, physical and mental health needs. Local faith-based organizations also can offer suggestions on swim accommodations that meet your family’s beliefs and traditions. \n",
