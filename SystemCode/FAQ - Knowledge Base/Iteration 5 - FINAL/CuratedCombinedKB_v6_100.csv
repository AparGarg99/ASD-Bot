"I am a female with suspected ASD, but professionals and others have tended to discount my suspicions. What should I do?","While diagnoses of ASD in males continue to increase, the referrals and diagnoses for women have not followed this pattern and females may be diagnosed later in life, especially if they are considered 'high functioning'. There are a few possible reasons for this, including socialization to a 'gender role', better abilities to cope with stressful situations, and better developed social skills. Signs and symptoms of an ASD may be less obvious. Therefore, it is important to see a diagnostician who is familiar with the presentation of ASD in females.

Start with just a few more minutes spent on each activity or by adding one other opportunity during the week when your child can participate. While tablets, computers and television might be useful in small amounts for learning opportunities or as rewards, too much screen time can take away from time spent in active play.
