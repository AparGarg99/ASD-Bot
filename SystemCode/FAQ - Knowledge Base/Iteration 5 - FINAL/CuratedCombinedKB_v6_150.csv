What have studies found regarding MMR vaccine and autism?,"Available epidemiological data show that there is no evidence of a link between measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorders. Previous studies suggesting a causal link were found to be seriously flawed. There is also no evidence to suggest that any other childhood vaccine may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorders.  In addition, evidence reviews commissioned by WHO concluded that there was no association between the use of vaccine preservatives such as thiomersal and autism spectrum disorders.

Can adults be diagnosed with autism?,"Yes, adults can be diagnosed with an ASD. Diagnosis includes looking at the person's medical history, watching the person's behavior, and giving the person some psychological tests. But, it can be more challenging to diagnose an adult because it is not always possible to know about the person's development during the first few years of life, and a long history of other diagnoses may complicate an ASD diagnosis.

What are mitochondrial diseases or disorders?,"Mitochondria are tiny parts of almost every cell in your body. Mitochondria are like the power house of the cells. They turn sugar and oxygen into energy that the cells need to work. In mitochondrial diseases, the mitochondria cannot efficiently turn sugar and oxygen into energy, so the cells do not work correctly. Not everyone with a mitochondrial disease will show symptoms. However, when discussing the group of mitochondrial diseases that tend to affect children, symptoms usually appear in the toddler and preschool years.

What are the other forms of ASDs (besides Autism and Asperger's Syndrome)?,"Other disorders in the spectrum include pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS) and two rarer disorders: childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) and Rett's syndrome. Children with PDDNOS demonstrate symptoms similar to autistic disorder, but do not meet all criteria for the disorder. Children with CDD, which affects more boys than girls, develop normally until approximately the first two years of life (average onset of symptoms is between 3 and 4 years) but they then regress in most areas and continue worsening. Specifically, they experience a pronounced loss in motor, language, social and intellectual skills. Seizures may even occur.

What disorders are related to austism?,"Certain known genetic disorders are associated with an increased risk for autism, including Fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, each of which results from a mutation in a single, but different gene. Recently, researchers have discovered other genetic mutations in children diagnosed with autism, including some that have not yet been designated as named syndromes. People with ASD also have a higher than average risk of having epilepsy. Children whose language skills regress early in life before age 3 appear to have a risk of developing epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity.

What is Asperger's Syndrome?,"Asperger's Syndrome is the second most common ASD and is a milder form of autism. Children with Asperger's Syndrome exhibit higher language development than children with autism and often have normal intellectual ability combined with a disinterest in social communication. Children with Asperger's may not initiate or sustain a conversation and do not compensate for their limited language by using nonverbal means of communication, thus limiting their peer relationships. Similar to autism, children with Asperger's do not share enjoyment or interests with others.

A single gene mutation has been identified as a cause of Rett syndrome, a finding that may enable researchers to develop improved diagnostics, earlier interventions and better treatments for the condition.

Why do people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) sometimes have a difficult time making eye contact?,"Researchers recently have found that people diagnosed with ASD have a hard time making eye contact. In one study, the subcortical system of the brain was shown to exhibit a high activation, which researchers believe may be the basis of people with autism avoiding eye contact in daily life. This pathway is involved in facial recognition and detection. In infants, the more this pathway is used, the better the visual cortex develops. This can help give the person diagnosed with autism and their loved ones an improved ability to recognize social cues and communicate with one another.

In addition to describing your special child, the letter of intent identifies specific doctors, services and resources that will help your child enjoy the highest level of independence and self-reliance. The document is a valuable tool that communicates knowledge only parents may know, including specific hopes and desires for their child's future well being, to the very people who will be caring for the child after the parents no longer are able to do so.
