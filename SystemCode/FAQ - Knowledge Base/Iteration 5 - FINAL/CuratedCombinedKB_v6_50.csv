Speech Development in ASD?,"An analysis of ARI's (Autism Research Institute) data involving 30,145 cases indicated that 9% never develop speech.

With appropriate interventions, there is reason to hope that children with autism can learn to talk, at least to some extent, and non-verbal older children and adults can sometimes learn to talk or communicate in other ways.
