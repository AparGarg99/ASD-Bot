Specific interventions should be tailored to each individual's needs and may include both behavioral and pharmacological interventions. Many children benefit from a multidisciplinary team that may include applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapists, speech and language pathologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists and other professionals. There is currently no cure for autism.

Can I wait to have my child tested for Autism?,"There are scientifically validated tests, such as the M-CHAT, that can be used to screen for autism in children as young as 15-18 months. What screening tests do is point to social problems that should be investigated by a health professional, such as a paediatrician or child psychologist. The earlier a child receives a diagnosis the better, as it means they can start on early intervention to help address their social and behavioural challenges.

The Food and Drug Administration has advised pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children limit their intake of certain types of fish, like tuna, that tend to contain high levels of methylmercury in order to prevent excessive methylmercury consumption. Thimerosal consists of 49% ethylmercury. The most definitive study to date was conducted by Danish researchers (Hviid et al., 2003). It looked at thousands of children who received either vaccines containing thimerosal or vaccines without this preservative and found that the rates o f autism were identical in the two groups.

How can I find the best treatments for myself or my autistic child?,"Research suggests that early intensive behavioral intervention, based on applied behavioral analysis, is effective at improving language, function and behavior in individuals with autism. There are two drugs, risperidone and aripiprazole, that can improve challenging behaviors such as emotional distress, aggression, hyperactivity and self-injury, but these drugs do not lead to improvements in social skills or communication. Interventions focused on parent training and cognitive behavioral therapyÂ can improve social skills, communication, language use and management of challenging behaviors.

These medications generally function by altering the level of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain. There is no medical test to determine if a particular medication is called for; the decision is based on the psychiatrist's evaluation of the patient's symptoms.

ABA is an approach to analyzing each individual's skill deficits and problem behaviors. Each child brings with them a distinct set of difficulties. No single treatment package can be used for all children and ABA is a method for examining the needs of each person. Specific instruction can then be tailored to a child's unique situation.

Generally parents become concerned when their child has delays in speech development, limited social relatedness, and restricted interests and activities.

 1. Social relatedness 
 2. lack of developmentally-appropriate make-believe or social play. 
 3. Restricted interests and activities

Subsets of autism ranges from mild to severe. We can say that every case in autism is unique. While some individuals on the autism spectrum have great art skills and above-average intelligence, some have above below-average to average intelligence. Most people on the spectrum can have a distinctive ability resulting from their peculiar way of viewing the world, while others suffering from autism are unable to live without aid.

Why ABA?,"No single ""treatment package"" will serve every child's needs and no individual can claim to own ABA. ABA is the application of the principles of learning to 1) build skills and 2) treat problem behavior. It works because each person's behavior is assessed to determine what skills they have not mastered and what types of problem behavior interfere with learning and social functioning. For skill deficits, direct instruction is provided until the skill is mastered. For problem behavior, specific analysis of why the behavior occurs is used to develop treatment to eliminate the behavior or teach the person to use other more appropriate behavior to serve the same function.

What medical tests should the doctor perform when making a diagnosis of ASD?,"Routine medical tests are usually performed by traditional pediatricians, but these exams rarely reveal underlying medical problems that are often associated with autism, such as gastrointestinal problems, nutritional and metabolic deficiencies, toxic metal burden, and immune dysfunction. Unfortunately, many physicians believe, though incorrectly, that the only useful medical treatments are psychiatric medications to reduce seizures and behavioral problems. Genetic testing for Fragile X syndrome can help identify one possible cause, and this testing is typically recommended when there is IDD in the family history. The Autism Research Institute supports an integrative medical approach to treating individuals on the autism spectrum.
